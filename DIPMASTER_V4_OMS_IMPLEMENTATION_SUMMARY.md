## üîß Key Features Implemented

### 1. Order Execution Strategies

#### TWAP (Time-Weighted Average Price)
```python
# Intelligent time slicing with randomization
num_slices = max(1, min(20, duration_minutes // 2))
slice_interval = duration_minutes * 60 / num_slices
qty_variation = np.random.uniform(0.8, 1.2)  # Anti-gaming
```

#### VWAP (Volume-Weighted Average Price)
```python
# Volume-weighted time buckets based on historical patterns
hour_weights = [0.8, 0.6, 0.4, ..., 2.2, 2.0, ...]  # 24-hour profile
slice_qty = total_qty * (weight / total_weight) * 8
```

#### Implementation Shortfall
```python
# Urgency-based execution with front-loading
participation_rate = min(0.2, urgency * 0.3)
weight = np.exp(-i * 0.3) if urgency < 0.7 else 1.0
```

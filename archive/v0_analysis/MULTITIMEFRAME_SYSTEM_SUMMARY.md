## 🔄 Signal Processing Workflow

### 1. Data Ingestion
```
Market Data → [1H, 15M, 5M, 1M] → MultiTimeframeSignalEngine
```

### 2. Individual Timeframe Analysis
```
For each timeframe:
├── Trend Direction Analysis (EMA, ADX, Linear Regression)
├── Technical Indicators (RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, Stochastic)
├── Volume Profile Analysis
├── DipMaster-Specific Metrics (Dip Quality, Exit Timing)
└── Signal Confidence Calculation
```

### 3. Confluence Calculation
```
Weighted Confluence Score = 
  (1H_Signal × 0.40) + 
  (15M_Signal × 0.35) + 
  (5M_Signal × 0.20) + 
  (1M_Signal × 0.05)
```

### 4. Signal Classification
```
Confluence Score → Signal Strength:
├── ≥ 0.8: STRONG_BUY/STRONG_SELL
├── ≥ 0.6: BUY/SELL  
├── ≥ 0.4: WEAK_BUY/WEAK_SELL
└── < 0.4: HOLD
```

### 5. Execution Optimization
```
Signal + Market Context → Execution Strategy:
├── Method Selection (Market/Limit/TWAP/VWAP)
├── Position Sizing (Risk-adjusted)
├── Timing Optimization (Urgency-based)
└── Risk Level Setting (Stop/Take Profit)
```
